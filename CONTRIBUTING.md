### Project Structure Guidelines

#### New Projects
When adding new projects, follow this structure:
```
your-project/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md              # Project-specific documentation
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .gitignore            # Language-appropriate gitignore
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Dockerfile            # If applicable
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ docker-compose.yml    # If applicable
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ src/                  # Source code
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ tests/                # Test files
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ docs/                 # Additional documentation
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ examples/             # Usage examples

- Usage examples
- API documentation (or links)
- Contributing information
- License information

#### Code Documentation
- Public functions/methods must have documentation
