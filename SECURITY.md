# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We actively support and provide security updates for the following versions:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| Latest  | :white_check_mark: |
| Previous major | :white_check_mark: |
| Older versions | :x: |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

### 1. Do NOT create a public issue
Security vulnerabilities should not be disclosed publicly until they have been addressed.

### 2. Report privately
Send a detailed report to our security team:
- **Email**: [Create a private security advisory](https://github.com/myselfgus/tools/security/advisories/new)
- **GitHub Security Advisory**: Use GitHub's private vulnerability reporting feature

### 3. Include in your report
- **Description**: Clear description of the vulnerability
- **Impact**: Potential impact and attack scenarios
- **Reproduction**: Steps to reproduce the vulnerability
- **Affected versions**: Which versions are affected
- **Proposed fix**: If you have suggestions for fixing
- **Credits**: How you'd like to be credited (if at all)

### 4. Response timeline
- **24 hours**: Initial acknowledgment of your report
- **72 hours**: Initial assessment and severity classification
- **7 days**: Detailed response with our planned approach
- **30 days**: Target for resolution (may vary based on complexity)

## Security Best Practices

### For Contributors

#### Code Security
- **Input validation**: Always validate and sanitize inputs
- **Authentication**: Use secure authentication mechanisms
- **Authorization**: Implement proper access controls
- **Encryption**: Use encryption for sensitive data in transit and at rest
- **Dependencies**: Keep dependencies updated and scan for vulnerabilities

#### Secrets Management
- **Never commit secrets**: API keys, passwords, tokens should never be in code
- **Environment variables**: Use environment variables for configuration
- **Secret scanning**: Enable GitHub secret scanning
- **Rotation**: Regularly rotate API keys and access tokens

#### Code Practices
- **Static analysis**: Use SAST tools to identify security issues
- **Dependency scanning**: Monitor dependencies for known vulnerabilities
- **Code reviews**: All code must be reviewed before merging
- **Testing**: Include security testing in your test suites

### For Users

#### Installation Security
- **Verify sources**: Only install from official repositories
- **Check signatures**: Verify package signatures when available
- **Use specific versions**: Pin to specific versions in production
- **Regular updates**: Keep tools updated to latest secure versions

#### Configuration Security
- **Least privilege**: Grant minimum necessary permissions
- **Secure defaults**: Use secure configuration defaults
- **Network security**: Implement proper network security measures
- **Monitoring**: Monitor for unusual activity

## Vulnerability Types

### High Priority
- **Remote code execution**: Ability to execute arbitrary code
- **SQL injection**: Database access vulnerabilities
- **Authentication bypass**: Circumventing authentication mechanisms
- **Privilege escalation**: Gaining unauthorized elevated access
- **Data exposure**: Unauthorized access to sensitive data

### Medium Priority
- **Cross-site scripting (XSS)**: Client-side code injection
- **Cross-site request forgery (CSRF)**: Unauthorized request execution
- **Information disclosure**: Unintended information leakage
- **Denial of service**: Service availability issues
- **Insecure defaults**: Unsafe default configurations

### Low Priority
- **Security misconfigurations**: Suboptimal security settings
- **Insecure dependencies**: Dependencies with known low-severity issues
- **Information leakage**: Minor information disclosure
- **Weak cryptography**: Use of weak cryptographic algorithms

## Security Tools and Scanning

### Automated Security Scanning
We use various automated tools to identify security issues:

- **GitHub Security Features**:
  - Dependabot for dependency updates
  - CodeQL for static analysis
  - Secret scanning for leaked credentials
  - Vulnerability alerts for dependencies

- **Third-party Tools**:
  - SAST (Static Application Security Testing)
  - DAST (Dynamic Application Security Testing)
  - Container security scanning
  - License compliance checking

### Manual Security Reviews
Critical components undergo manual security reviews:
- Architecture and design reviews
- Code reviews focused on security
- Penetration testing for web applications
- Infrastructure security assessments

## Incident Response

### Response Team
Our security response team includes:
- Repository maintainers
- Security specialists
- DevOps engineers
- Legal counsel (for serious incidents)

### Response Process
1. **Assessment**: Evaluate severity and impact
2. **Containment**: Immediate measures to limit exposure
3. **Investigation**: Detailed analysis of the vulnerability
4. **Remediation**: Develop and test fixes
5. **Communication**: Notify affected users and stakeholders
6. **Prevention**: Implement measures to prevent recurrence

### Communication
- **Security advisories**: For confirmed vulnerabilities
- **Release notes**: Include security fixes in release documentation
- **Blog posts**: For significant security updates
- **Direct notification**: For critical vulnerabilities affecting specific users

## Compliance and Standards

### Standards Compliance
We strive to comply with relevant security standards:
- **OWASP**: Follow OWASP security guidelines
- **NIST**: Align with NIST cybersecurity framework
- **CIS**: Implement CIS security benchmarks where applicable
- **Industry standards**: Follow industry-specific security requirements

### Regular Assessments
- **Quarterly**: Dependency vulnerability assessments
- **Semi-annually**: Security tool configuration reviews
- **Annually**: Comprehensive security posture review
- **As needed**: Incident-driven security assessments

## Acknowledgments

We appreciate the security research community and responsible disclosure practices. Contributors who report security vulnerabilities will be:
- Credited in security advisories (if desired)
- Recognized in our security hall of fame
- Given priority support for future reports

## Legal

### Safe Harbor
We support safe harbor for security researchers who:
- Make a good faith effort to avoid privacy violations and data destruction
- Only interact with accounts they own or have explicit permission to test
- Do not exploit vulnerabilities beyond demonstrating the issue
- Report vulnerabilities promptly
- Keep vulnerability details confidential until resolution

### Reporting Guidelines
- Act in good faith to avoid privacy violations
- Do not access or modify data belonging to others
- Do not perform denial of service testing
- Do not spam or send unsolicited communications
- Comply with all applicable laws and regulations
